# üèéÔ∏è F1

Scrapes a live photo every ~30 minutes of the Formula 1 race track's build
progression in Las Vegas, NV. Scheduled completion is October 2023, a month
before the race begins.

## Summary

The data source on the scraped images is an updating live photo feed sourced
from the official Formula 1 website. As long as it remains up and transmitting
data, this project will continue to auto-update.

The photos are automatically pushed to the `./assets` folder of this repository,
and will be stitched together into a timelapse video at the end of the project.
