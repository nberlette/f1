## Capturing live photos of the Las Vegas Formula 1 track construction

This is a simple automated image scraper, designed to capture live photos of the
Formula 1 track that's being constructed in Las Vegas, Nevada for the Grand Prix
race in November, 2023. It was developed as an
[open source project by **Nicholas Berlette**](https://github.com/nberlette/f1)
using [**TypeScript**](https://typescriptlang.org) and
[**Deno**](https://deno.land/manual), and is fully automated by
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/nberlette/f1/actions). It requires no human
interaction to operate, and as long as the construction camera feed stays
active, it will capture a new photo at 10 minutes intervals.

The photos are stored in a public
[**GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/nberlette/f1), and will ultimately be
compiled into a timelapse once the track is completed.

> This is a personal project, with no commercial interests or any form of
> monetization, and was built purely out for educational and historical
> purposes. As of August 31st, it was amassed **over 11,111 photos** as of
> August 30th!

### Built with Deno

The project is powered by Deno, offering secure JavaScript runtime with
first-class TypeScript support. The logic behind the image scraping resides
primarily in the `src/scrape.ts` file in the project repository. I'm working on
a user interface for viewing the images that should be completed soon, so check
back here frequently!
