## Capturing live photos of the Las Vegas Formula 1 track build

This project is a purpose-built image scraper developed in TypeScript and powered by Deno. Its sole purpose is to capture a live snapshot every every ~10 minutes of the new Formula 1 race track that is currently under construction in Las Vegas, NV. 

It is automated by GitHub Actions to run at regular intervals, and leverages Deno KV for data persistance. For accessibility and additional redudancy (since Deno KV is still in beta), a hard copy of each scraped image is also pushed to the repository. Once the track is completed (or whenever the live stream goes offline), **all** of the photos it has collected will be then be compiled into a timelapse video using ffmpeg. That will conclude this project and it will then be archived.

The actual race (officially known as the **_"Formula 1 Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix 2023"_**) will be held on **November 18th, 2023**, with practice and qualifying the two days prior. For more information on the race itself, [**see the official site here**][formula1-official-site].

## How it Works

The majority of the work happens in [`main.ts`][main.ts], despite it only
being 3 lines of code. It is responsible for invoking the scraper located in
[`src/scrape.ts`][src-scrape.ts], and is ran every 10 minutes by a GitHub Action
defined by the workflow in [`main.yml`][workflow].

[üìñ **Click here for an in-depth explanation of the scrape process**](#scrape-process-step-by-step)

### Assets and Data

Images are named after their capture time as a `JPEG` file in **UTC**. For
example, an image captured at `2023-07-09T04:28:57` would be saved as
[`./assets/2023-07-09/04_28_57.jpg`](https://github.com/nberlette/f1/blob/main/assets/2023-07-09/04_28_57.jpg?raw=true). The latest image is always saved as [`./assets/latest.jpg`][latest-img] for easy
access.

#### Cloud Persistence

Each image is also persisted in a Deno KV database, backed by FoundationDB on
the edge thanks to Deno Deploy. For added redundancy and convenience.

#### Workflow Artifacts

All scraped assets are also saved as GitHub Workflow artifacts for 90 days,
allowing remote access without having to clone all the images.

### Tools Used

- [x] [`Deno v1.36.4`](https://deno.land/manual@v1.34.1) <small> _(for
      execution)_</small>
- [x] [`Deno KV`](https://docs.deno.com/kv/manual) <small> _(for data
      persistence)_</small>
- [x] [`GitHub Actions`](https://github.com/actions) <small> _(for
      automation)_</small>
- [x] [`TypeScript 5.1.6`](https://typescriptlang.org) <small> _(for type
      safety)_</small>
- [x] [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org) <small> _(for timelapse creation)_</small>

### Image Source

The data source on the scraped images is an updating live photo feed sourced
from the official Formula 1 website. As long as it remains up and transmitting
data, this project will continue to auto-update.

> This project will continue to update until the track is completed, but could
> be discontinued at any time if the image stream becomes unavailable.

## Scrape Process, Step-by-Step

1. GitHub Actions runner picks up the job every ~10 minutes, depending on
   traffic.
2. The runner checks out the repository, installs [Deno][deno], and executes the
   command `deno task scrape`, which in turn invokes the [`main.ts`][main.ts]
   file in the project root.
3. [`main.ts`][main.ts] checks if it is being run as intended (and not imported
   by another module), and if so dynamically imports `scrape` from
   [`src/scrape.ts`][src-scrape.ts] and immediately calls it.
4. [`src/scrape.ts`][src-scrape.ts] defines the asynchronous `scrape()`
   function, which internally defines functions named `read` and `write`. The
   following steps are taken:
   1. The latest image to be scraped is loaded into a new
      [`Image`][src-image.ts] instance.
   2. If necessary, the folder for the current day is created in
      [`./assets`][assets].
   3. `read()` is called with `IMAGE_URL` from
      [`src/constants.ts`][src-constants.ts].
      1. If the request fails, it will be retried up to the number of times
         defined by the `ATTEMPTS` constant, with an increasing delay between
         each successive attempt.
      2. If it fails after the last attempt, the job will fail and the runner
         will be terminated.
      3. If it succeeds, the image is returned as an instance of the
         [`Image`][src-image.ts] class, defined in
         [`src/image.ts`][src-image.ts].
   4. `write()` is called with the image as its only argument.
      1. The image is compared for equality against the latest image (scrape
         step 1). If they are equal, it means the image has not yet updated.
         - For a maximum of `ATTEMPTS` times, the image is re-scraped and
           compared against the latest image.
         - If they are still equal, the job will fail and the runner will be
           terminated.
      2. Now that we have a fresh image, it is first written to the `Deno KV`
         database using the [`Image.write()`][src-image.ts] method and logged to
         the console.
      3. The image is then written to the filesystem using the
         [`Image.writeFile()`][src-image.ts] method, and also logged to the
         console.
      4. The image is finally written to the [`./assets/latest.jpg`] file, and
         the updated image size difference is logged to the console.
      5. The [`setOutput`][src-helpers-actions.ts] method is called with the
         filename of the new image, so the GitHub Actions runner can use it as
         an output variable.
         - In additional, several other outputs are set with metadata about the
           image.
   5. The scrape is now complete and the runner proceeds to the next step.
5. The photo is uploaded as a GitHub Workflow artifact for 90 days of remote
   access.
6. The runner commits the changes to the repository, and pushes them to the
   repository.
7. The job completes and the runner is terminated.

## About

The photos are stored in the public
[**GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/nberlette/f1), and persisted to a
[FoundationDB-backed **Deno KV** database][deno-kv].

The first scrape happened on June 3rd, 2023. As of September 16th, it has
amassed **over 13,000 photos** and counting, totalling just over **1.0GB**!

### Who made this?

This project is actively maintained by [**Nicholas Berlette**][nberlette], and
was developed as an [open source project][readme] entirely in his personal time.
The technology used includes [**TypeScript**][typescript], [**Deno**][deno],
[**Deno KV**][deno-kv], and [GitHub Actions][github-actions].

This is a personal project, with no commercial interests or any form of
monetization, and was built purely out for educational and historical purposes.

## Further Reading

### Camera Location

The camera is at the "Harmon Paddock" zone of the track, located just southeast
of _"The Strip"_ (Las Vegas Blvd) near Harmon Avenue and Koval Lane. The camera
itself is mounted directly on the roof of the Paddock building, facing
south-southeast. It gives a great view of the grandstands (bleachers) and what
appears to be shaping up to be the start/finish line of the track.

#### Camera Angle Changes

Something which is completely out of my control is anything related to the
actual camera itself. That being said, when the construction crew suddenly chose
to relocate it on August 15th, it effectively split the timelapse part of this
project into two parts.

##### What changed?

The camera **_was_** facing north-northwest, giving a bird-eye view of the
Paddock area and the track's first corner, with the iconic Las Vegas Strip in
the background. As of August 15th, however, the camera is now facing
south-southeast towards the Harry Reid International Airport, with the MGM Grand
in the background to the right.

It's not all bad though - in my opinion, the new angle is far superior to the
previous one, and it provides quite a bit more content for us since it's in an
area with much more activity.

##### What are we doing about it?

The first angle will be made into a separate timelapse video, from June 3rd,
2023 through August 15th, 2023. The second angle will be from August 15th, 2023
through the completion of the track.

### Future Plans

A frontend display for viewing the images as a growing timelapse is under
development. This will also help create a timelapse video once the track build
is complete. Check [`n.berlette.com/f1`](https://n.berlette.com/f1) for updates.
