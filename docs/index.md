### Built with Deno

The project is powered by Deno, offering secure JavaScript runtime with first-class TypeScript support. The logic behind the image scraping resides primarily in the `src/scrape.ts` file in the project repository. I'm working on a user interface for viewing the images that should be completed soon, so check back here frequently!
